<!-- dice_rolling_simulator-->
Dice rolling simulator  
This sim can roll a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 20 sided die 
<!--This code uses match case to decide what dice is needed along with user input and the import random feature-->
Added a loop so you can continue to roll dice or quit  
Added a loop so you can roll multiple of the same dice at one time
<!--This did result in an error in the replay loop which I will work on in my next session-->
