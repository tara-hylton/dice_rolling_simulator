<!-- dice_rolling_simulator-->
Dice rolling simulator  
This sim can roll a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 20 sided die 
<!--This code uses match case to decide what dice is needed along with user input and the import random feature-->
Added a loop so you can continue to roll dice or quit  
Added a loop so you can roll multiple of the same dice at one time
<!--This did result in an error in the replay loop which I will work on in my next session-->
Updated all lines of code in match/case code  
Updated lines that print out to specify the dice and amount of dice that were rolled  
Fixed error in reroll loop, probably need to clean up code still, but it is working properly  
Cleaned up some code, added some comments to the program  
Made a function to get the input for the choice of dice and number of dice being rolled and added built in function to
verify that a positive integer is being used.
